# P-A-CW1
This is a password manager in C++. It uses cyclic hashing then double hashing to store the password and handle collisions. In addition, with every addition in the table the load factor is calculated if it is over 0.5 the entire table is rehashed and the capacity of the array is doubled. The encryption is done via ceaser cipher. Finally, the main function includes a input password for the user, a choice to generate a password, and the ability to retieve the password
